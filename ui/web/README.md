# Web UI

## Project setup

```shell
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
pnpm install
```

The simulator UI server must be enabled, use WebSocket and disable authentication. The simulator main configuration file should have a `uiServer` section like this:

```json
  "uiServer": {
    "enabled": true,
    "type": "ws",
    "authentication": {
      "enabled": false,
      "type": "basic-auth",
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "admin"
    }
  },
```

See [here](../../README.md#charging-stations-simulator-configuration) for more details.

### Run

#### Compiles and run for production

```shell
pnpm start
```

#### Compiles and run for development

```shell
pnpm serve
```

#### Try it out

For both options above you can then follow the link displayed in the terminal at the end of compilation. The Web UI looks like the following

1. With the top 2 buttons you can now stop and afterwards start the simulator and inspect the server console for the number of charging stations, e.g. with the default configuration: `Charging stations simulator ... started with 10 charging station(s)`
2. Each charging station is a row in the table below, try "Stop Charging Station" and refresh with the large blue button and see the status Started turns from Yes into No.

### Compiles and minifies for production

```shell
pnpm build
```

### Lints files

```shell
pnpm lint
```
